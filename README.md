# Cat-and-Dog-Binary-Classifier

This was a project created for an Intro to AI class at Mississippi State University. It's based on a binary classifier project on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&t=3659s&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte.
The data collected was from google images, where the images from the entire page were downloaded and images under a certain size were filtered out. This project's greatest benefit is the visualization it gives of what each filter and layer of the Sequential model created.
